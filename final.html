        <h2>Motive</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing websites are often included in emails. The recipient may mistakenly believe that these websites are official due to personal negligence, and then provide personal information to unscrupulous parties.In order to provide more proactive protection before the recipient of the message is deceived, we hope to use AI technology to detect phishing websites in emails and pop up a warning before the recipient clicks on the phishing website.

                <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The incoming email security solution checks all links in the email and replaces them with a special URL called "Safe Links". This way, when users click on the link, they are actually directed to the security provider's server rather than the original destination URL.</p>

                <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>When a user clicks on a Safe Link, the secure server checks whether the destination URL is safe. This often includes checking whether links lead to known malicious sites, contain phishing content, and other possible threats.</p>
